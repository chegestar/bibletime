=== remarks ====================================================================
Issues
.	Since sip panel didn't raise sip button it is not able to change software
	keyboard in the application. also default keyboard should have
	enter/return key to launch search. (wince)
.	To enable g-sensor support for runtime orientation change use third party
	applications like G-Config. (wince)
Qt
	we get nothing on application deactivation under wince
		handle WM_ACTIVATEAPP code in WM_ACTIVATE cause not working popups
		maybe replace WM_ACTIVATEAPP with WM_NCACTIVATE = 0x0086?
	QFont::setPointSize don't work on wince
	SIP adjusted to the bottom of screen
Sword
	exception with /MD option and signed c-strings, require /J
BibleTime
	set BT_MINI where needed
	static QDir initialization in directory.cpp causes exception on wince
