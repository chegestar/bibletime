                delay for nex release because may affect perfomance
?   restore search term
+   bug: somewhat with scrolling on tips if opened after first Bible installation
+   android: style switching does not working properly
!   switch currentIndex in view from time to time on on its deletion (avoid bad behavior with auto-scrolling)
        current item sould be changed right after current item was left the screen
    resize subview width, its primarily for tablets
        need to add two functions: expand window, contract window
    make sword text model and install model suitable for main repo
    move CInfoDisplay text processing to Core
	search by G25 (strong:G0025), and it is ambiguous G0025 and G25 in search
		there is bug with highlighting, search for strong:G25 highlights strong:G2523
    new look and feel
        ios style, fusion-based
    clippings
        reorganize ui
            1. move InstallManager to Module Selection, add Clippings to bottom bar
            2. remove bottom bar and add menu to top-right button (+ possible to add some non obvious functions here, + more space)
    in qtextdocument center headers
        make own filters for before:/after: selectors
            it is not simple, because we can not obtain :after insertion point and resolve correct selector
    apply settings on button press
    always open Settings on main page, not Handbook
        reimplement windows switching
    turn on/off text features (notes)
    sliding effect for main stacked widget



?   replace panel with android
?   move all logic from models to btminilogic.cpp
    adding functionality using default function parameters is bad practice, when you want to change them
    download indexes feature

    centralized parallel processing:
        get data from sword
        install a module
        build search index (maybe build will be resumeable, maybe index displayed verses)
        maybe backend reloading
        ability for blocking execution (e.g. first text entry)
        make this suitable for main repo
        should know what is current view (text/install), current text, probably via signals/slots
    install module logic:
        pressing on a module display dialog 'Dow You want to Install %1?'
        - any existing panel becomes a progress bar with cancel button
        - installation starts in parallel thread, user able to proceed selecting modules
        progress bar shown in module item

    settings ui
        restrict v11n mode feature: off, kjv, synodal, vulg, ...
        chapter mode
?   design changes
        cut-off menu overlays, open contex full-size
        sliding panels for queries
        hideable bottom panel
        top area to indicate current location
    selecting items and active item
    current subview indication
    footnote display using icon
?   restore original BT paths, or dirs in resources
    bug, delayed module verses layout stops on missed content
    bug, sometimes on Matt n navigation second level opens as books again
    bug, sometimes book stay unlocalized in text view in chapter area
    unlock locked modules

    make commentary context parallel computed
        make work array and threads array static
    current module seem to fail to get text from sword after module installation

    memory leaking on wince, crtdebug detect leaking starting from QApplication init
    QTextDocument issues
        not load external style sheet
            it would be possible to load with absolute path
        font enumeration in font-family dont work
    replace unistd.h with io.h/direct.h on wince
    merge linked verses in model
    ? new menu look
    context for word even without tagging (dictionary lookup)
    new system for context modules: add/remove from context lookup

    new style of sliding, next view doesn't slide but fade
    topbar with animated effect when go sub level
    find way to communicate with scrollbar to display current position and marks
?   maybe make scroll bar transparent and overlapping view
?   scrolling like book pages, good because user's eyes always move all around the screen
    bookmarks would be named as Cuttings or Clippings
    notes - based on personal commentary module with av11n mapping support remark, should be created by app

=== tasks for future ===========================================================
    verse features
        bookmarks
            nested bookmarks folders
            date created (for sorting)
            place in uri format (sword://Module/Key)
            static / dynamic
        verse colors
    
    re-concept interface

    Link, like Opera Link to synchronize bookmarks and all Per Verse Data among all user devices
        maybe need Sword change that every verse in Bibile at every v11n has unique id
    multitouch
    linked lists
        slide list and stroke down/up to link
        link neighbor lists: items will be fitted by height, empty verses will be displayed hollow
    verse features
        ratings/favourite
            no ranges, byte-array
        readings
            reading should be as restoreable view
            get / set (on switch and destroy) place
            remember module also
            place, module, date started, date visited
?        colors
        reading count
            created as byte-array for every versification
?            increased when exceed 256-bound
?            converted between v11ns on call
            or maybe implement this through history

?    sliding, animated backgrounds
?    read html / txt / rtf / doc formats

=== SWORD ======================================================================
    load locales on demand
%   av11n mappings
    load av11n on demand from file
    make more steps for search

=== remarks ====================================================================
Issues
    Since sip panel didn't raise sip button it is not able to change software keyboard in the application.
        also default keyboard should have enter/return key to launch search. (wince)
    To enable g-sensor support for runtime orientation change use third party applications like G-Config. (wince)
Qt
    we get nothing on application deactivation under wince, solved by using winEvent
    QFont::setPointSize don't work on wince, solved by QFontMetrics::height
    SIP adjusted to the bottom of screen
    qt color names not used on device to optimize library size
Sword
    exception with /MD option and signed c-strings, require /J
BibleTime
    set BT_MINI where needed
    static QDir initialization in directory.cpp causes exception on wince
