=== remarks ====================================================================
Issues
    Since sip panel didn't raise sip button it is not able to change software keyboard in the application.
        also default keyboard should have enter/return key to launch search. (wince)
    To enable g-sensor support for runtime orientation change use third party applications like G-Config. (wince)
Qt
    we get nothing on application deactivation under wince, solved by using winEvent
    QFont::setPointSize don't work on wince, solved by QFontMetrics::height
    SIP adjusted to the bottom of screen
    qt color names not used on device to optimize library size
Sword
    exception with /MD option and signed c-strings, require /J
BibleTime
    set BT_MINI where needed
    static QDir initialization in directory.cpp causes exception on wince
